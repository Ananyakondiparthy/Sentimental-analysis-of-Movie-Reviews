Sentimental analysis of Movie Reviews
![Sentiment result Example](https://github.com/Ananyakondiparthy/Sentimental-analysis-of-Movie-Reviews/blob/master/image.png)

I worked with a dataset of movie reviews and identify reviews as having either a positive or negative sentiment. I explored this data and trained my own sentiment analysis model using the deep learning framework PyTorch. Then, deployed the model and create a gateway for accessing it from a website using AWS resources i.e Amazon Sagemaker: ml.m4.xlarge instance.
